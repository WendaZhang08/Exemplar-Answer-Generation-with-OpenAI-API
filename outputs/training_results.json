      "answer": "They need to make sure that the quantity of fuel will produce the strongest reaction, which will give the rocket the biggest thrust as it takes off. They also need to be precise with fuel measurements because they can't carry extra fuel - the extra weight would weigh the rocket down and impair its ability to exit the atmosphere",
