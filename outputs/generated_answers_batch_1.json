  "The fin design that worked best for our rocket was the triangular fin configuration. This design provided optimal stability during flight, allowing the rocket to ascend straight up without any significant rolling or veering to the side. The triangular shape effectively redirected airflow, minimizing drag and enhancing aerodynamic efficiency. \n\nDuring our trials, we measured the stability of the rocket's flight path, and the triangular fins consistently resulted in a more vertical ascent compared to other designs, such as rectangular or rounded fins. We controlled variables such as the rocket body weight, size, and launch angle to ensure a fair test. This allowed us to accurately observe the performance of each fin design.\n\nIn conclusion, the triangular fin design was superior due to its aerodynamic properties and ability to maintain stability, which are crucial for successful rocket launches."
