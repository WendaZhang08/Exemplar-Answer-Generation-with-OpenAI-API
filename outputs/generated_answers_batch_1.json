  "**Which fin design worked best? Why?**\n\nThe fin design that proved to be the most effective in our rocket trials was the triangular fin configuration. This design consistently provided superior aerodynamic stability and ensured a straighter flight path compared to alternative designs, such as rectangular or circular fins. \n\nDuring our experiments, we conducted multiple trials with each fin design while controlling key variables, including the rocket body mass, the amount of \u2018fuel\u2019 (baking soda and vinegar), and the launch angle. By maintaining these variables constant, we could accurately assess the impact of the fin shape on the rocket's performance. \n\nThe triangular fins, made from lightweight cardboard, were strategically placed at equal distances from the rocket\u2019s center of mass. This placement contributed to improved aerodynamic efficiency by reducing drag and enhancing stability during the ascent. In contrast, the rectangular fins created more turbulence due to their larger surface area, which often led to unwanted rolling motions. The circular fins, while visually appealing, did not provide sufficient surface area for stability, resulting in erratic flight patterns.\n\nFurthermore, the triangular design allows for a better distribution of airflow around the rocket. As the rocket ascends, the pointed shape of the triangular fins helps to streamline the airflow, effectively guiding it over the rocket body and minimizing resistance. The angled edges of the fins also contribute to a more stable trajectory by allowing the rocket to correct itself when faced with lateral forces during flight.\n\nIn conclusion, the triangular fin design was the most effective due to its optimal combination of stability and aerodynamic efficiency. The findings from our trials clearly indicate that this design fosters a straighter and more controlled ascent, which is critical for the success of any rocket launch."
