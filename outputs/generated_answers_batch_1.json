  "The fin design that worked best was the triangular fin. This design provided superior stability during the rocket's flight, which was evidenced by the rocket's ability to launch straight up without rolling or veering to one side. The triangular shape helped to create a balanced aerodynamic profile and effectively directed airflow around the rocket, reducing drag and enhancing stability.\n\nIn our trials, we measured the angle of ascent and observed the flight path of each rocket design. The triangular fins consistently yielded a vertical trajectory, whereas other designs, such as rectangular or circular fins, caused the rocket to wobble or tilt during ascent. This indicates that the triangular fins were more effective in maintaining the rocket\u2019s orientation and preventing unwanted rotation.\n\nIn conclusion, the triangular fin design was the most efficient due to its aerodynamic properties and ability to stabilize the rocket, which ultimately contributed to a successful launch and flight path."
